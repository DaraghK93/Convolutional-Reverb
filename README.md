# Convolutional-Reverb

## To Run

This file is split into 3 sections: FFT (fast fourier transform) convolution in the frequency domain, which takes two audio files as arguments and produces an effiiently processed signal; Time Domain convolution, which is a less efficient method and also takes two files; plotting functions, whcih plot the time and frequency domain graphs of the processed or unprocessed audio signals.

Uncomment the function running beneath it's definition and pass the audio files in to run the convolution functions
